## WORK EXPERIENCE
### Centre on Knowledge Graphs, Information Sciences Institute, USC [AI Researcher] (Jun 2021–Present)
* Generated semantically annotated dataset of 250 tables using Wiki Tables and corresponding dependency relation between the columns.
* Analyzed evaluation metrics for the robustness of tabular embedding models in preserving semantic information under perturbations.
* Automated tabular block annotation transfer between sheets with identical layouts based on anchors and constraints from structural features.


### Thoughtworks Technologies (India) Pvt Ltd., Koramangala, Bengaluru [Full-stack Application Developer] (May 2016–Dec 2020)
* Implemented Spark-based  ETL pipeline for price recommendations and sales forecasting using historic data for pre/in-season planning.
* Enabled end user to perform real-time price edits and data visualizations through golang micro-services and React based Web-UI.
* Led successful application deployments in the production environment on AWS, resolving various technical and data migration issues.
* Tuned spark cluster by simulating production like price-edits using Locust and decreased the computation time by 25-30%.
* Containerized Jenkins server and slaves using docker in order to support deployment across different cloud service providers.
* Led the team of 5 developers to design and develop the Alexa-enabled Stock-market Robo-advisor app modeled by the data science team.
* Designed and implemented application features as centralized application configuration management, policy-based functional and data access control, GoCD continuous delivery pipeline.


## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

### Directed Research: Relation Extraction from Financial Documents (Jan 2022-Present)
* Experimenting with state-of-art semi-supervised and active learning approaches to further improve the relation extraction performance.
 
### Potential Relation and Global Correspondence (PRGC) based Joint Relational Triple Extraction (Aug 2021-Dec 2021)
* Implemented a 3-stage model (Potential relation detection, Relation specific entity extraction and Subject-Object alignment using global correspondence) using Pytorch and achieved an extraction F1 score of 85% on WebNLG dataset.
* Used bert-base-uncased pre-trained embeddings to encode text and generated embeddings from scratch for encoding 216 relations.
* Performed computational analysis to calculate number of parameters and total FLOPs using ptflops package.

### Neural Dependency Parser using Arc-eager shift-reduce (Oct 2021-Nov 2021)
* Generated neural training features and labels from Penn Tree Bank dataset in CoNNL format based on arc-eager parsing steps.
* Applied 2-head Feed-forward neural network to predict transition and arc-label for each arc-eager parsing step based on the extracted features. Neural parser is supported with additional rules to avoid illegal transitions during inference. Obtained an F1 score of 0.73 over the test dataset.

### Text Classifiers (Naive Bayes, Feed Forward Neural Network) using numpy  (Sep 2021-Oct 2021)
* Implemented various classification models with different target objectives over questions, products, 4dim and odiya datasets.
* Implemented back-propagation, dropouts and neural layers just using numpy and handled out of vocabulary words by intentionally dropping less frequent words. Performed grid-search for hyper-parameter tuning to choose optimum number of hidden units, dropout rate, maximum sequence length, training batch size etc.

### Fully Convolutional Network with ResNet-18 backbone for Image Segmentation  \hfill{Oct 2021
* Used pre-trained features from ResNet-18 model and added deconvolution/transpose convolution layers to implement FCN32 and FCN16 segmentation model. Performed training and evaluation over Kitti dataset and obtained pixel classification accuracy of 79% and mean IOU of 30%.
